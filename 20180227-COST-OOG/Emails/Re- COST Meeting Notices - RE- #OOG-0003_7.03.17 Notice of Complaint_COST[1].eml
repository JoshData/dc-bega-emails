Good afternoon, Traci =E2=80=93

=20

I am continuing to compile the information that you requested.  But as susp=
ected, I am running into some roadblocks =E2=80=93 mostly, finding either recordin=
gs or  written notes of some of the COST meetings that took place before my =
and Vanessa=E2=80=99s arrival into our current positions.  I know that you wanted =
this material by tomorrow.  But, I would like to request a bit more time.  W=
e are short-staffed in our ALJ-corps  right now.  So, we are working more cl=
osely than usual with the Clerk=E2=80=99s office and the Chief Judge to make sure =
our hearings and schedulings are handled on time and efficiently.  Also, we =
are currently trying to arrange the next meeting of the COST so that  we can=
 get some of our ALJ=E2=80=99s reappointed and working. =20

=20

If you could give me until next week =E2=80=93 Wednesday, at the latest, I would =
appreciate it.  I understand that you are not asking for much.  It=E2=80=99s just =
a matter  of us locating some of the items you requested and being able to d=

Thank you for your email.  In addition to the searches that you have alread=

first two years of that timeframe.  We will also review the available files =
that the prior GC and Supervisory Attorney  Advisor kept prior to Vanessa ar=

I also believe we can provide you with everything we can find by September =

Hi Vanessa and Neal --

=20

I'm turning back to this, and would like to close the above-referenced matt=
er out.  Will you please provide copies of all notices, agendas and recordin=
gs (audio, transcripts and/or meeting minutes) of  both open and closed sess=
ion meetings of the COST from January 1, 2014 - July 30, 2017?=20

=20

I am asking for this specific range of records because the OOG conducted a =
training of all COST members on the requirements of the OMA on November 21, =
2013. It was a combined ethics and OMA training  that was conducted at OAH. =
 I must review these records to ascertain the COST's compliance with OMA fro=
m the date of this initial training. This will inform the formal findings re=
lated to complaint.  All records pertaining to closed sessions must, and wil=
l,  be held confidential by the OOG. Records of the closed sessions are need=
ed to determine whether proper protocol was followed. =20

=20

Aside from what I see on the DC Register http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Search/Fu=
llTextSearch.aspx?SearchType=3DDCR&KeyValue=3DSelection+and+Tenure,  the OAH web=
site https://oah.dc.gov/newsroom?field_date_value%5Bmin%5D%5Bdate%5D=3D&field_=
date_value%5Bmax%5D%5Bdate%5D=3D09%2F13%2F2017&keys=3DSelection+and+Tenure&field=
_release_type_tid=3DAll&sort_by=3Dfield_date_value&sort_order=3DDESC, and the OOG =
central calendar https://www.open-dc.gov/search/node/Tenure, was  notice pro=
vided on the OAH website and/or the central calendar for COST meetings, open=
 and closed, that took place between January 1, 2014 - July 30, 2017? If not=
ice was provided, please provide documentation indicating the dates the noti=
ces were published  on the website(s). I do not need documentation regarding=
 meetings published on the OOG central calendar.

=20

I also did a search of yearly calendar meeting dates of the COST on the DC =
Register website, and did not find anything. If the COST has been submitting=
 yearly meeting dates to the DC Register, please  provide those records as w=
ell.

=20

Finally, I see that there was a 7/28/17 meeting cancellation notice on the =
OAH website. The notice of the meeting is on the open-dc.gov website. The 7/=
28/17 meeting appears to have been cancelled the same day. What was the reas=
on for the late cancellation, and when was the public informed of the cancel=
lation?

=20

If the any of the requested records to not exist, it is critically importan=
t that the members of the COST formally assert.

=20

Thank you.  Please call me if you have any questions. Please let me know if=
 there is something I can do to facilitate. I can have someone bring down so=
me cd's/drive if needed.=20

=20

If possible, I'd like to get all of the requested files by 9/21/17. =20

 a training of all COST members on the requirements of the OMA on November 2=
1, 2013. It was a combined ethics and OMA training
 that was conducted at OAH. &nbsp;I must review&nbsp;these records to&nbsp;=
ascertain the COST's compliance with OMA from the date of this initial train=
ing. This will inform the formal findings related to complaint. &nbsp;All re=
cords pertaining to closed sessions must, and will,
 be held confidential by the OOG. Records of the closed sessions are needed=
 to determine whether proper protocol was followed. &nbsp;</span></p>
