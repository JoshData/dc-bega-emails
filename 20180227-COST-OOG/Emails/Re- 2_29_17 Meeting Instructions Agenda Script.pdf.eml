Attached are the 9/22 emails you and Johnnie sent instructing me on the pro=
tocol for the COST meeting.  Also attached is the meeting Agenda and the =E2=80=9C=
script=E2=80=9D that I gave to the COST Chair to follow during the meeting.  It do=
es appear that  I failed to put one item in the Chair=E2=80=99s script.  But I wan=
ted to show you our genuine effort to follow the rules.  Thanks!
