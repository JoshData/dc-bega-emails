I forgot to mention that Judge Josey-Herring was a mayoral appointee to COS=
T.  She was appointed in 2007 by Mayor=E2=80=99s Order 2007-150 and reappointed in=
 2013 by Mayor=E2=80=99s Order 2013-135.

Here are my answers to your questions:

=20

1.         Who the three COST members were who resigned in protest during M=
ary Oates Walker=E2=80=99s tenure?

=20

            Charlotte Brookins-Hudson, Judge Gregory Jackson, Rohulamin Qua=
nder.

=20

2.         Which of them was the Chair?

=20

            Charlotte Brookins-Hudson

=20

3.         What were the approximate dates of their appointments (if you re=
call)?

=20

            Rohulamin Quander (August 2, 2013 by the Mayor.  Mayor=E2=80=99s Orde=
r 2013-208)

=20

Charlotte Brookins-Hudson (May 6, 2008 by Council Resolution 17-611.  Reapp=
ointed by Resolution 19-103)

=20

            Judge Gregory Jackson (approximately December 2010)

=20

4.         Did Yvonne Williams replace Judge Jackson and if so, to finish h=
is term before she was appointment anew to a full term?

=20

            I don=E2=80=99t know since it happened after I left.  Maybe Nadine kn=
ows.

=20

5.         Was Anita Josey-Herring ever a COST member and, if so, do you re=
call when?

=20

            Yes.  She was appointed by Chief Judge Satterfield in September=
 2009 and was elected chair of COST on September 16, 2009.

=20

6.         Finally, do either of you have any emails or other documents tha=
t might reflect any of this information?

=20

            I have provided some references above.  Let me know what else y=
ou need.
