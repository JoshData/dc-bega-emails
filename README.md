BEGA Emails Dump
================

This repository contains emails sent to or from the DC Board of Ethics and Government Accountability (BEGA) in 2017-2018 retreived through FOIA requests.

* 20180227-COST-OOG: Emails released on Feb. 28, 2018 per [this tweet](https://twitter.com/DCOPENGOV/status/968915998786162688) related to BEGA's Office of Open Government's investigation into the DC Commission on the Selection and Tenure of Administrative Law Judges (COST). I am not sure who initiated this FOIA request.
* 20180313-BEGA-JT: Emails released on March 13, 2018 in response to a FOIA request I submitted for emails sent to/from BEGA related to the Office of Open Government. This set of emails came from a preliminary response to my request - the complete request is still pending. Most of these emails were given to me in Outlook .msg format. I [converted them to .eml format](https://github.com/JoshData/convert-outlook-msg-file).
