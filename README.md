BEGA Emails Dump
================

This repository contains some emails sent to, from, or about the DC Board of Ethics and Government Accountability (BEGA) in 2017-2018 retreived through FOIA requests.

* In the [20180313-BEGA-JT](20180313-BEGA-JT) directory: Emails released on March 13, 2018 in response to a FOIA request I submitted to the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability for emails sent to/from BEGA related to the Office of Open Government.  Most of these emails were given to me in Outlook .msg format. I [converted them to .eml format](https://github.com/JoshData/convert-outlook-msg-file).

* [2018-FOIA-02709-EOM-JT.pdf](2018-FOIA-02709-EOM-JT.pdf): Emails released on March 27, 2018  in response to a FOIA request I submitted to the Executive Office of the Mayor for emails dated on or after July 1, 2017 in which there is a discussion of a) the performance or responsibilities of the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability (BEGA)’s Office of Open Government or the responsibilities of the position of Director of BEGA’s Office of Open Government or b) any proposed legislation regarding BEGA, and c) emails sent to or from the board members of BEGA.

* In the [20180227-COST-OOG](20180227-COST-OOG) directory: Emails released on Feb. 28, 2018 per [this tweet](https://twitter.com/DCOPENGOV/status/968915998786162688) related to BEGA's Office of Open Government's investigation into the DC Commission on the Selection and Tenure of Administrative Law Judges (COST). I am not sure who initiated this FOIA request.
