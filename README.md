BEGA Emails Dump
================

This repository contains some emails sent to, from, or about the DC Board of Ethics and Government Accountability (BEGA) in 2017-2018 retreived through FOIA requests.

See [emails.html](https://joshdata.github.io/dc-bega-emails/emails.html) for a single-page dump of the 20180313-BEGA-JT and 20180227-COST-OOG emails, described below. Note that emails given to me in redacted PDF are un-chronologically put at the end. The EOM emails are in a separate PDF linked below. Thanks to [Albert Bowden](https://github.com/jalbertbowden) for help converting the FOIA responses to HTML.

* In the [20180313-BEGA-JT](20180313-BEGA-JT) directory: Emails released on March 13, 2018 and March 20, 2018 in response to a FOIA request I submitted to the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability for emails sent to or from BEGA board members on or after July 1, 2017 related to a) board agendas and minutes, b) the Office of Open Government within BEGA, or c) proposed legislation, and d) emails sent to or from the Executive Office of the Mayor or the Council of the District of Columbia.  Most of these emails were given to me in Outlook .msg format (which I [converted them to .eml format](https://github.com/JoshData/convert-outlook-msg-file)) and some were PDFs with redactions.

* In the [20180227-COST-OOG](20180227-COST-OOG) directory: Emails released on Feb. 28, 2018 per [this tweet](https://twitter.com/DCOPENGOV/status/968915998786162688) related to BEGA's Office of Open Government's investigation into the DC Commission on the Selection and Tenure of Administrative Law Judges (COST). I am not sure who initiated this FOIA request.
