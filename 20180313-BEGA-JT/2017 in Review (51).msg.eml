Letter from the Mayor


Dear Washingtonians,

With the new year less than two weeks away, I want to acknowledge just a
small fraction of all that we accomplished together in 2017. By staying
true to our DC values and committed to building a better city for all,
this year, we:

*	launched the I
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-announces-immigrant-justice-l
egal-services-grant-program> mmigrant Justice Legal Services
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-announces-immigrant-justice-l
egal-services-grant-program>  grant program, a new initiative that
provides funding to community-based organizations and law firms that do
legal work for immigrants in our community;
*	expanded STEM and extracurricular programming
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-highlights-investments-middle
-and-high-schools>  in our middle and high schools to ensure more
students have access to a wide-range of opportunities both inside and
outside the classroom;
*	increased investments in high-quality, affordable child care
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-highlights-increased-investme
nt-affordable-child-care>  options to give more children and families a
strong start;
*	opened the Safer Stronger DC Office of Neighborhood Safety and
Engagement
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-opens-safer-stronger-dc-offic
e-neighborhood-safety-and-engagement>  which will focus on
community-oriented, public health approaches to violence prevention;
*	recommitted to uphold and honor the goals of the Paris Climate
Accord
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-signs-executive-order-binding
-district-paris-climate-accord> ;=20
*	continued to make historic investments in affordable housing
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-makes-historic-investment-138
-million-affordable-housing>  across all eight wards; and
*	created new programs and initiatives - like Solar Works DC
<https://doee.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-launches-summer-cohort-solar-w
orks-dc-accepts-solsmart-gold-award>  and the DC Infrastructure Academy
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-launches-dc-infrastructure-ac
ademy>  - that will ensure more Washingtonians have the skills and
knowledge they need to fill good-paying District jobs.=20

Along the way, crime decreased, student achievement continued to
increase, our local economy remained one of the strongest in the
country, and we found new ways to protect and defend our city's most
vulnerable residents. In short, in 2017, we went above and beyond to put
DC values into action.=20

This holiday season, I am grateful for the opportunity to serve my
hometown, and I look forward to another year of building on all we have
accomplished together.=20

Sincerely,=20
