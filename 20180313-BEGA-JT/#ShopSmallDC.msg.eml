Letter from the Mayor


Dear Washingtonians,

In recent years, local creatives, makers, and entrepreneurs across all
eight wards have helped bring District-made retail back to Washington,
DC. Our small and local businesses continue to drive economic
development, employ DC residents, and invest in our communities.Today,
people are happy and proud to shop in Washington, DC.=20

When Washingtonians share their talents and creativity with our city, we
want to do all we can to support them. Last month, we celebrated the
opening of Shop Made in DC <http://shopmadeindc.com/> , a new brick and
mortar store and caf=C3=A9 stocked exclusively with DC brands and concepts.
Tomorrow, I will celebrate Small Business Saturday on Minnesota Avenue,
DC's newest Main Streets designee. And next week, the Council and I will
host a variety of District-based entrepreneurs at the Wilson Building
for a pop-up Made in DC: Holiday Bazaar
<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mayor-bowser-hosts-john-a-wilson-building-
holiday-bazaar-tickets-40111761358> .

Small businesses are the backbone of our economy - the reason our
private sector job growth continues to outpace public sector growth. It
is my great pleasure to celebrate our local makers. Tomorrow, next week,
and throughout the year, I hope you will join me in supporting the local
entrepreneurs, risk-takers, and go-getters who support our city.

Sincerely,=20

On Monday, Mayor Bowser launched Home for the Holidays
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-launches-campaign-move-400-fa
milies-and-individuals-permanent-housing-during> , a citywide campaign
to place 400 of the District=E2=80=99s most vulnerable households into perman=
ent
housing during the holiday season. The Mayor made the announcement at
the 72nd lease-agreement signing of the campaign, standing alongside a
District resident as she signed the lease for her family=E2=80=99s new home.

In addition to working with landlords throughout the city to move
families and individuals into permanent housing, the Administration has
also called on residents to donate housewares and other items to help
furnish the new housing. Donations of new or gently used kitchenware,
toys, housewares, and professional clothing will be collected from the
community and disseminated throughout the campaign. Residents can drop
off donations at the Adams Place Day Center (2210 Adams Place, NE) or
email homefortheholidays@dc.gov <mailto:homefortheholidays@dc.gov>  for
more information.
