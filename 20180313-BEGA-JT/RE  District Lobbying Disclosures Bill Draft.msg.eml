Good afternoon, Michael.

As you may know, Darrin left BEGA in July =E2=80=93 Brian is the Interim
Director =E2=80=93 but I=E2=80=99m writing to confirm our continuing willingn=

testify in favor of Bill 22-344. =20

=20

Coincidentally, our own bill (Bill 22-136) also has been noticed for
hearing on Nov. 2.  See attached Notice.  Needless to say, we=E2=80=99d
appreciate Councilmember Cheh=E2=80=99s support.  Let me suggest, then, that =
we
get together in the near future to discuss the bills.  I know our
Chairperson, Tameka Collier, who will likely be presenting the
testimony, would appreciate the opportunity to meet you and the
Councilmember in any event.

=20

Please, then, suggest a few good times for a meeting.

Thanks.

Fantastic. Thanks so much for this, Darrin.

This is thinking far ahead in the bill process, but, once the bill is
introduced and a hearing is set, it would be great to have someone in
your office testify about the need for the bill. I=E2=80=99ll keep you updated
as that process moves forward.

	Hi Darin and Janet,

	=20

	I wanted to reach out to you all with a draft of the legislation
related to updating the District=E2=80=99s lobbying disclosure laws to include
procurement actions so as to fall in line with other jurisdictions. I=E2=80=
=99m
hoping you all might take a look at what I=E2=80=99ve drafted up, and tell me=
 if
you think it adequately addresses the issues you identified in your
recent letter. Feel free to red line or give me a call to discuss any
changes or issues with the text, as drafted.

	=20

	As I mentioned to Janet, there is no rush on getting edits back
to me =E2=80=93 we would likely introduce any legislation next month at the
earliest.

	Thanks for any thoughts.
