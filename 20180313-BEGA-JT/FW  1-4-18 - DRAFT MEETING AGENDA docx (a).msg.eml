	I forgot to note that the specific language for closure includes
the appointment and removal of government employees, rather than a
general personnel description. So, no OMA provision will be violated if
the agenda is specific in this regard. See section 2-575:

	=20

	(10) To discuss the appointment, employment, assignment,
promotion, performance evaluation, compensation, discipline, demotion,
removal, or resignation of government appointees, employees, or
officials;

		Hi Jack-

		Notice to the public requires that agenda items be
stated with specificity. Although the discussion of personnel matters is
an authorized reason for closure, the public is entitled to know the
general subject matter as long as the listing the topic would not
jeopardize privacy in the personnel matter itself. See OMA section
2-576(5):

		  (5) Each meeting notice shall include the date, time,
location, and planned agenda to be covered at the meeting. If the
meeting or any portion of the meeting is to be closed, the notice shall
include, if feasible, a statement of intent to close the meeting or any
portion of the meeting, including citations to the reason for closure
under =C2=A7 2-575
<https://beta.code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/2-575.html>
(b), and a description of the matters to be discussed.

			Thanks, Traci, but why, if the Board does take
up the OOG position in closed session, is a specific statement
necessary?  Wouldn=E2=80=99t the reference to personnel matters (as in the
attached draft) be sufficient?

			Good morning.

			=20

			The OOG agenda items are included in the
attached.

			Jack, if the board intends to discuss the
appointment of the OOG director in closed session, it must be
specifically stated in the closed session description. If so, please
insert into the language in agenda, and send to Waddah for publication
on the website.
