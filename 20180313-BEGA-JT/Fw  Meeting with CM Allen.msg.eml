Hi Tameka --


We (me and the Open Government Coalition) met with CM Allen on the transparen=
cy bill and the OOG amendment act. We also discussed the EOM's proposal (not =
a bill yet) to expunge arrest records of people who are prosecuted, but not f=
ound guilty.


I'm happy to brief you on it when you have time.  The long and short of it is=
 that neither the transparency bill, nor the remaining portion of the amendme=
nt bill will be moved forward anytime soon. He may revisit the transparency b=
ill in the Spring.


I hope you are well.


Traci
