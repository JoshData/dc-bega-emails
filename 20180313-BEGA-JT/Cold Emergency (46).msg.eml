Letter from the Mayor


Dear Washingtonians,

Yesterday, we activated the District's Cold Emergency Plan
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/district-activate-cold-emergency-plan-toni
ght> . The plan, which will remain activated until 7:00 a.m., Tuesday,
January 2, ensures that we have additional services and supports
available to protect residents from life-threatening illness and injury
associated with severe cold weather.=20

During this extreme cold, it is critical that we all watch out for one
another's safety. Now is the time to call the Shelter Hotline when you
see residents experiencing homelessness who are outside and to check on
neighbors who might need assistance. To request transportation to
shelter for someone experiencing homelessness, contact the Shelter
Hotline by calling (202) 399-7093 or 311.

Sincerely,=20

 Muriel
Bowser<https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/DCWASH/2

ICYMI: Prepaying 2018 Property Taxes


Last week, Mayor Bowser, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, and Chief
Financial Officer Jeff DeWitt announced that District property owners
can prepay their property taxes in preparation for the upcoming tax
year. The federal tax reform legislation limits the amount of state and
local income and real property taxes that individuals may deduct from
their federal income tax, beginning in calendar year 2018. Under the new
law, the amount that may be deducted is limited to $10,000 of the
combined local income or sales taxes and real property taxes.=20

How to Prepay Real Property Taxes

Before making an advance payment, residents should consult a tax
advisor.

If a taxpayer chooses to prepay property taxes given their federal tax
situation, they may choose to base their property tax prepayment on the
amount paid in the previous half-year. The prepayment can be for the
entire fiscal year (October 1, 2017-September 30, 2018). Once the
prepayment for 2018 is made in 2017, adjustments based on the corrected
amount will be included in subsequent billings. These adjustments may be
due to factors such as the homestead deduction, senior deduction, or
other changes that impact billings.

Taxpayers can prepay online by going to the District Office of Tax and
Revenue website at www.taxpayerservicecenter.com
<http://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com>  and clicking on the prepay 2018
tax banner. They can then put in their property information and, after
it is selected, click the =E2=80=9CPay Here=E2=80=9D button at the bottom of =
the page
and then pay by e-check. They will need their checking or savings
account number and routing number. This option is available until
midnight on December 31.

The other option is to go to any District Wells Fargo branch where they
can pay via check or credit card. They will need to bring their latest
property tax bill so their account is credited appropriately.  This
option is available until close of business for the particular branch on
Saturday, Dec 30.

Christmas Tree Recycling

The District offers two environmentally-friendly ways for residents to
recycle Christmas trees and greenery. Between January 13 and February 2,
residents can put their trees and greenery out with trash and recycling,
to be collected on regularly scheduled recycling days
<https://dpw.dc.gov/service/find-your-trash-and-recycling-collection-sch
edule>  during this period. This collection service is only available to
residents who are serviced by the Department of Public Works. (Note: In
years past, residents could place their trees in the tree box space,
adjacent to the curb. This is not the case this year, unless that is
where recycling is normally collected.)

Residents can also bring their trees and greenery to either of the
District=E2=80=99s transfer stations - the Fort Totten Transfer Station (4900
John F. McCormack Drive, NE) or the Benning Road Transfer Station (3200
Benning Road, NE).

Before disposing of a tree or greenery, all ornaments and lights should
be removed. Residents are also asked not to bag their trees or greenery.

This past summer, Mayor Bowser kicked off the first cohort of Solar

low-income residents. A joint effort between the Department of Energy
and Environment and the Department of Employment Services, the program
provides on-the-job technical training to DC residents ages 18 and over.

Applications for the upcoming spring cohort are being accepted until
