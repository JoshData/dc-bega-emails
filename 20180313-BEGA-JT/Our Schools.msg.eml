Letter from the Mayor


Dear Washingtonians,

Last week, I had to deliver some devastating news about our public
schools.

After allegations surfaced about graduation irregularities at our
comprehensive high schools, I promised to immediately get to the bottom
of what happened at Ballou and ensure the integrity of DC Public Schools
(DCPS).=20

To do this, we:

*	commissioned a third party investigation with a private firm,
overseen by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE),
*	followed the facts as they became available,
*	publicly presented the facts,
*	held those responsible for wrongdoings accountable, and
*	set a clear and deliberate course to fix what is broken.

The OSSE investigation revealed poor student attendance, a culture of
graduating students despite poor attendance, training and technology
failures within DCPS, and pressure to pass students in order to meet or
exceed graduation goals. Misapplied policies and a desire to help our
most disadvantaged students led to a series of failures we must now
overcome.

Our Progress

These findings are indeed startling, and fixing what got us here is my
top priority. But as we move forward, we cannot ignore or discount the
real progress our schools and students have made. In the last ten years:

*	DCPS was recognized as the fastest improving urban school
district in the country based on the National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP);
*	we made unprecedented investments in the backbone of our system
=E2=80=93 our teachers;
*	after years of enrollment decline, families are once again
choosing our public schools;
*	the transformation of our school buildings and learning
facilities have ensured our students have the schools and resources they
deserve;
*	we expanded STEM and extracurricular offerings at our middle
schools, setting more students up for success in high school; and
*	by switching to the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for
College and Careers (PARCC) exam, we have improved how we are preparing
our students for success after high school.

There is no debating that our reforms and these accomplishments are the
result of a renewed focus on our students that began in 2007 when we
made DCPS an executive agency with Council oversight. And, today, we
know there is much more work to do.=20

Regaining Your Trust

As we confront our challenges, I want to be very clear that we will not
tolerate any forms of cheating in our school system. When this occurs,
it jeopardizes our students, our taxpayers, and our future as a city.=20

The immediate actions that we have taken to restore faith in our school
system include:

*	appointing a Chief Integrity Officer at DCPS;
*	holding members of DCPS leadership accountable for
attendance/grading and school-level failures; and
*	referring the investigative reports to the DC Inspector General
for additional evaluation, with a commitment to do the same for any
future allegations of impropriety that we receive.

Information on other upcoming changes, including updates to the DCPS
grading and credit recovery policies and the implementation of
end-of-course assessments for core courses by school year 2022, can be
found at attendance.dc.gov <https://attendance.dc.gov/node/1307671> .

But we won=E2=80=99t stop there: Beginning with the Class of 2018, we are
working to ensure that every DCPS diploma has the value that our
students deserve. DCPS is already in the process of conducting
comprehensive reviews of student transcripts and ensuring that schools
have support systems and aligned accountability systems to properly
follow attendance, grading, and credit recovery policies this semester.
This will inevitably lead to some tough conversations with our students
and families. Seniors will be informed whether they are on track to
graduate, and if not, what options they have. We want every student to
succeed, and we will have the appropriate supports in place to help them
do so.=20

Starting at Ballou, DCPS will host resource fairs to connect more
students and families to the supports they need to be successful in
school, including on attendance. We want to hear directly from students
about what obstacles they face so that we can help them overcome those
challenges. And, going forward, it is critical that we continually
instill in our students that there is nothing more important to me, you,
or our city than their individual success.

I want to assure you that my resolve to do what is right for our young
people has never been stronger. Together, we will continue to have the
courage to improve and put more students on a path to success. For our
students and their families, the best is yet to come.

Sincerely,=20
