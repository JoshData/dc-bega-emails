Letter from the Mayor


Dear Washingtonians,

Just over one year ago, I reminded Washingtonians that our values did
not change on Election Day in November 2016. At the time, I reaffirmed
our status as a sanctuary city, and during a citywide community
conversation, I reiterated that DC Government was going to defend our
residents and our values.

Now, as I reflect on the past year, I want to say thank you. Thank you
for fighting for your neighbors. Thank you for standing up for diversity
and inclusivity. Even without a vote in Congress, you have made our
voices heard and defended against what, at times, can feel like a
never-ending attack on our country's progress. Thank you for never
giving up.=20

In terms of defending our DC values, this week has been a busy one:

*	On Monday morning, I called on Congress to rethink tax reform
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/congress-raises-tax-burden-low-income-and-
middle-class-families-mayor-bowser-announces> . By cutting deductions
for teachers and union members and eliminating tools used by
jurisdictions across the country to create affordable housing, the
current House and Senate tax bills will make life harder for low-income
and middle class Americans. Congress must do better. =20
*	Later that day, at the inaugural North American Climate Summit,
I pledged to make Washington, DC carbon-neutral and climate resilient
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-commits-make-washington-dc-ca
rbon-neutral-and-climate-resilient-2050>  by 2050. Earlier this year, I
signed a Mayor=E2=80=99s Order reaffirming the District=E2=80=99s commitment =
to adopt,
honor, and uphold the Paris Agreement. Through this pledge, we are
honoring that commitment.
*	On Tuesday, the Director of my Office of LGBTQ Affairs stood on
the steps of the Supreme Court and spoke out against legalizing
discrimination. =20
*	Yesterday, on a day I proclaimed "DREAMers Day," I joined
leaders and residents across the country in calling on Congress to pass
a clean Dream Act
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-calls-congress-pass-clean-dre
am-act-proclaims-today-dreamers-day> . =20

This work is important, and together, we are making a difference. As we
get ready to head into 2018, let's prepare for another year of defending
and promoting our DC values.=20

Sincerely,=20

This week, Mayor Bowser highlighted the ongoing success of the Robbery
Intervention Task Force and urged residents to take advantage of MPD's
Exchange Zone Program
<https://mpdc.dc.gov/release/mpd-exchange-zone-locations-reminder> .
Last year, MPD set up three exchange zones
<https://mpdc.dc.gov/release/mpd-announces-exchange-zone-locations> .
These areas serve as a safe place for residents and visitors to exchange
and complete transactions of online purchases.The safe exchange zone
locations include:=20

*	Special Operations Division=E2=80=99s Harbor Patrol (550 Water Street,
SW)
*	Third District (1620 V Street, NW)
*	Sixth District (5002 Hayes Street, NE)

Since the implementation of the Robbery Intervention Task Force in late
2015, robberies have decreased across all police districts. Year to
date, the District has experienced a 27 percent reduction in robberies;
since the end of 2014, robberies have decreased by 33 percent, including
decreases in all eight wards.
