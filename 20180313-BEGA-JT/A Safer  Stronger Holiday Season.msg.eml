Letter from the Mayor


Dear Washingtonians,

Last week, while highlighting the work of our Robbery Intervention Task
Force
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-highlights-success-robbery-in
tervention-task-force> , I was proud to report that our Safer, Stronger
DC <https://mayor.dc.gov/page/saferstronger>  plan is working. We still
have work to do, but year-to-date, Washington, DC has seen a 23 percent
decrease in violent crime, a 27 percent decrease in robberies, a 28
percent decrease in burglaries, and a 10 percent decrease in overall
crime.

So, how are we doing this? With your help.=20

Among the many initiatives included in the initial Safer, Stronger DC
plan was legislation to create a Private Security Camera Incentive
Program. Eventually launched in February 2016, this program provides
rebates and vouchers for the purchase, installation, and registration of
private security camera systems. In under two years, the program has
already built a network of nearly 8,000 cameras across all eight wards
of the District. And we still know that more homes and neighborhoods
could benefit from this program.

This holiday season, learn more about the Private Security Camera
Incentive Program and let DC Government bring you the gift of home
security. Get started on helping us build a safer, stronger DC HERE
