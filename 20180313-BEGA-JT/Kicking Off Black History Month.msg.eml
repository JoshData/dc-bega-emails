Letter from the Mayor


Dear Washingtonians,

There is no better place to be during Black History Month than
Washington, DC. The District's history is black history, and while we
celebrate this history all year round, February gives us a special
opportunity to collectively recognize the many people, events, and
movements that have shaped our history and inspired millions.

Over the next few weeks, we will come together at art shows, book talks,
film festivals, and more to celebrate our achievements and look forward
to the future. We will honor the men and women whose shoulders we stand
on while planning for the success of our children.=20

Today, I am excited to release A Fair Shot: A Toolkit for African
American Prosperity
<https://dmgeo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dmgeo/publication/att
achments/PathwaytoProsperity.pdf>  =E2=80=93 a first-of-its-kind resource for
African American residents that provides an overview of the many
District-funded programs and services that support Washingtonians in
reaching pathways to the middle class. This toolkit will serve as a
guide for residents - outlining services available for individuals,
seniors, families, and business owners - and ensure that those who could
benefit most from these programs know about them. =20

African American Washingtonians have always been here for DC, and we
will continue to be here for you. =20

Sincerely,=20

 Muriel
