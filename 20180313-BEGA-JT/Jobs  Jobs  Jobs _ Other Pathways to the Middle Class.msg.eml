Letter from the Mayor


Dear Washingtonians,

My Administration talks a lot about creating jobs and building other
pathways to the middle class for Washingtonians. At schools, flower
shops, libraries, playgrounds - no matter the occasion or location, if
we're there, we're probably talking about jobs and building pathways to
the middle class. And we have no plans to let up. Spreading prosperity
and bringing more good-paying jobs to Washingtonians is our top
priority.=20

And after three years in office, I have never been more hopeful about
this work. Today, we have more and better programs and resources in
place for our residents, and every day, we continue to learn, adapt, and
innovate. The unemployment rate is down, and like we said we would, we
are connecting residents young and old to housing, workforce development
programs, educational opportunities, health care, and multi-modal
transportation options. Just yesterday, I celebrated more than 400
families and individuals housed
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-celebrates-more-400-families-
and-individuals-housed-during-%E2%80%9Chome-holidays%E2%80%9D>  during
our two-month Home for the Holidays campaign. On Monday, I rode with
residents down the busy 14th Street corridor on the new 59 MetroExtra
Express bus
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/kick-pathwaystothemiddleclass-week-mayor-b
owser-launches-metroextra-59-express-bus-service> . And today, I
celebrated the "topping off" of the new Entertainment and Sports Arena
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-celebrates-%E2%80%9Ctopping-o
ut%E2%80%9D-new-entertainment-sports-arena-st-elizabeths-east>  in
Congress Heights, a project that we announced during my first year in
office, and that has already created hundreds of jobs in Ward 8 with
many more on the way.

Every day, we continue to witness these successes. Some wins seem more
significant than others, but they are all critical to building a
stronger, more inclusive middle class, and combined they are getting
more Washingtonians - residents like Betty Henderson
<https://bidenforum.org/leaping-toward-the-middle-class-f4789afce60a>  -
on pathways to the middle class. =20

Sincerely,=20
