I don=E2=80=99t have any substantive comments on the testimony.  I would note
that the title of the Board Chair is =E2=80=9CChairperson.=E2=80=9D  D.C. Cod=
e =C2=A7
1-1162.03(c). That was changed from =E2=80=9CChairman=E2=80=9D in the 2017 Bu=
dget
Support Act.   I would also recommend paginating the testimony, so that
if there are questions on it during the testimony, it will be easier to
pinpoint the location in the testimony.

Janet has prepared a summary of other jurisdictions that have
procurement lobbying statutes.  It will be available tomorrow.  That was
an issue that was raised at the Bar meeting this afternoon =E2=80=93 who would
be required to register if the bill was adopted.  CM Allen again
distanced himself from the monthly lobbyist registration requirement,
but did mention that he might advocate quarterly filing.  Our e-filing
system would make it easier to do that.  There were no other significant
issues raised at that meeting.  Most of the focus was on campaign
finance reform.

Please provide edits and comments on the attached testimony.  I don't
plan to read the entire testimony but wanted to have it on the record.
Couple of things:

=20

1.	Should I reference the other two bills?
2.	I'll send an updated powerpoint once I figure out how to edit
the title page.
3.	I don't see Bob on the list to testify...change of plans?
4.	I don't see my name on the list to testify...change of plans?=20
5.	Brian and I spoke yesterday on the pushback from ANCs.  I think
it best addressed during live testimony.  Let me know if you think it
should be highlighted in written testimony too.

Thanks,

Tameka
