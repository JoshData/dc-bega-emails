Mr. Grimaldi:

I am sorry that we have not been able to connect.

I received one voicemail message from you. I returned that call, but was not =
able to reach you. The same thing occurred just moments ago. I understand tha=
t you met with Betsy Cavendish to discuss this issue. I intended to be at tha=
t meeting, but it was rescheduled to a time that did not accommodate my sched=
ule.=20

Certainly, the Mayor support efforts to achieve ethical government, but, typi=
cally, the Mayor does not take a position on measures prior to a hearing. As =
of now that is the case for this measure.=20

Nonetheless, I look forward to working with you and the Committee to refine t=
he bill as necessary as it moves forward.

Thanks,
Alana

Good morning, Alana.

We are now less than a week from the Committee hearing on Bill 22-136.  The b=
ill represents the first major overhaul of the Ethics Act since the Mayor (as=
 then Chairperson of the Council Committee on Government Operations) lead the=
 way to its passage in 2011.  I understand that, while vetting our current Bo=
ard Chairperson, Tameka Collier, the Mayor even referred to the Ethics Act as=
 "her baby."

I am surprised, then, that you have not responded to my several efforts to ar=
range a meeting to discuss the bill, beginning with my October 2 email immedi=
ately below.  I followed up on the email by leaving you voicemail messages on=
 October 6 and 16.

That said, your silence leaves us to guess at what the Mayor's position is on=
 the bill.  We want to be clear, however, as we anticipate answering question=
s from Committee members and otherwise preparing for the hearing.  Please, th=
en, let us know where the Mayor stands.  A meeting to have that discussion wo=
uld still be welcome.

Thanks.

Alana, sorry we missed you at the meeting this morning to discuss Bill 22-136=

 your end.

Thanks.
