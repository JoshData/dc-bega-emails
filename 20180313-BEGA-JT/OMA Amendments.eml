Good morning. Thank you for looking over the amendments.







I will omit the amendment to the feasibility language. Although I cannot be=
 100% certain, it has not been my experience with members of the public inq=
uiring about public meetings that they are looking to the DC Register as as=
 the primary source of public body meetings. In practice, the public I have=
 encountered, always reference meetings and agenda listed not he public bod=
y website.




Regarding #2, all public bodies have the ability to, at minimum, record on =
audio via a digital recorder or through recording technology in "wired" roo=
ms across the city. The statute itself says "record by electronic means," s=
o OOG does not propose changing that language. Other than public bodies enc=
ountering technical issues with equipment, I have not received any feedback=
 from public bodies regarding an inability to record by way of audio. Nor d=
o I hear from public bodies as trainings that recording on audio is impract=
ical. The easiest form of compliance with "electronic means" is audio recor=
ding, as the cost of digital recorders are minimal and the city offers seve=
ral meeting locations where public bodies can record.




Additionally, the OOG has consistently interpreted the 3-business day requi=
rement as having being met with a publication of draft meeting minutes, bec=
ause public bodies do not convene every three days to finalize meeting minu=
tes. This way public bodies can meet the disclosure/transparency objectives=
 of the OMA, while not being under unreasonable time constraints to comply.




Perhaps we can finalize at the next board meeting, since the DC Register ha=
s returned the amendments for submission with the proper transmittal form?

Traci,




See below for my thoughts on two of your proposed OMA amendments.  On a gen=
eral note, although I have no objection to the majority of the proposed cha=
nges, I think some of them are substantive, not technical, as they would al=
ter requirements imposed on public bodies and strengthen OOG's enforcement =
powers as interpreted by Judge Campbell in the Yates case.




1.
        2-576.  Removing "if feasible" from paragraph 1 makes the duty to e=
stablish an annual schedule an unqualified requirement.  As I mentioned pre=
viously, if the public body publishes this schedule (which, interestingly, =
is not expressly required in 2-576), the public could be misled about actua=
l meeting dates (ex. if the public relied solely on the yearly calendar we =
published in the DC Register, they would miss our Feb 1 meeting.  The unwav=
ering and therefore enforceable requirement should be limited to the 48 hou=
rs notice requirement.
2.
        2-578.   Are we (DC Govt) advanced enough to require without qualif=
ication that all meetings be recorded by electronic means?  Do you have a s=
ense how many public bodies currently record their meetings (vs just keepin=
g minutes)?  I'm not opposed to the requirements  in 2-578 but think they a=
ltogether (record and take minutes, post draft meeting minutes in 3 days, f=
ull record including recording available within 7 days, final meeting minut=
es by next meeting of public body) could be burdensome on smaller public bo=
dies with less resources.   Also note that you should delete "at notation" =
in the last proposed sentence of paragraph (b)(1).


Thanks,
Tameka
