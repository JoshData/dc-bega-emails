January 25, 2018 | Vol. 4, Issue 4


Letter from the Mayor


Dear Washingtonians,

On Sunday, January 21, I announced that in 2018 we will close DC General
<https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-prepares-closure-dc-general-s
helter>  once and for all, moving forward with our plan to replace the
shelter with smaller, service-enriched programs throughout all eight
wards. This closure has been a long time coming, and it is what our
families deserve.=20

While closing DC General is a huge step forward for our city and
progress we can be proud of, there is more work to do to ensure all
District residents have a fair shot at pathways to the middle class. We
must continue the reforms we are making to our homeless services system.
These reforms have helped thousands of families avoid a shelter stay
over the past three years, connected more than 3,300 single adults to
permanent housing, and led to a 22 percent reduction in family
homelessness between 2016 and 2017. We must continue to create
good-paying jobs while investing in our workforce training programs. The
unemployment rate is down, and as we continue to create job training and
apprenticeship programs that work better for residents and businesses,
we need to ensure that Washingtonians know about and are taking
advantage of these opportunities.=20

And we must continue to invest in affordable housing so that residents
of all backgrounds can continue to live and thrive in Washington, DC.
For the past three years, my Administration has made unprecedented
investments in our Housing Production Trust Fund, investing $100 million
each year. These investments have helped spark the creation or
preservation of more than 10,400 affordable units, with another 2,900 on
the way. And today, I joined a bipartisan group of mayors and CEOs from
around the country to launch Mayors & CEOs for U.S. Housing Investment
<http://www.housinginvestment.org/> , a first-of-its-kind coalition of
local government and business leaders who will work together to get more
people the resources they need to secure affordable housing.

Together, we will ensure that as our city grows, more Washingtonians
have the resources and opportunities they need to succeed.

Sincerely,=20

 Muriel

On Friday, January 26, at 12:00 p.m., online applications for the Mayor
Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (MBSYEP) will go live at
summerjobs.dc.gov <http://summerjobs.dc.gov> . Applications will be
available for youth who want to apply for a position as well as
employers who want to get involved with MBSYEP.

MBSYEP is a locally-funded initiative that provides District youth ages
14-24 with enriching and constructive summer work experiences through
subsidized placements in the private and public sectors. In 2015, Mayor
Bowser expanded the program so that District residents ages 22-24 can
participate in MBSYEP.

This year, MBSYEP will begin on Monday, June 25, 2018 and end on Friday,
August 3, 2018.
