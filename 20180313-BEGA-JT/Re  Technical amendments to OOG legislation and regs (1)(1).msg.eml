Yes, of course.

As I noted when we spoke on last Friday, the regs had already been submitted =
for the 12/22 publication. I just checked online, and the proposed amendments=
 have been published. There is a 30 day commend period, so there is still tim=
e for board input.


Regarding the legislation, it was my intent to have the board review prior to=
 submitting to CM Allen.


I have included both in my update for tomorrow's meetings. I omitted the incl=
usion of the amendments in my update items on the agenda, and will ask that t=
he topic be added to the agenda before final adoption at the start of the mee=
ting.

Traci-

I've copied Jack and the Board.  I want to have a chance to discuss the propo=
sed regulations and amendments with them before you move forward. Will you wa=
it to push these until after we've had a chance to weigh in?  Thanks.

Tameka
