Good afternoon, Michael.

=20

As you may know, Darrin left BEGA in July =E2=80=93 Brian is the Interim
Director =E2=80=93 but I=E2=80=99m writing to confirm our continuing willingn=
ess to
testify in favor of Bill 22-344. =20

=20

Coincidentally, our own bill (Bill 22-136) also has been noticed for
hearing on Nov. 2.  See attached Notice.  Needless to say, we=E2=80=99d
appreciate Councilmember Cheh=E2=80=99s support.  Let me suggest, then, that =
we
get together in the near future to discuss the bills.  I know our
Chairperson, Tameka Collier, who will likely be presenting the
testimony, would appreciate the opportunity to meet you and the
Councilmember in any event.

=20

Please, then, suggest a few good times for a meeting.

=20

Thanks.

Fantastic. Thanks so much for this, Darrin.

=20

This is thinking far ahead in the bill process, but, once the bill is
introduced and a hearing is set, it would be great to have someone in
your office testify about the need for the bill. I=E2=80=99ll keep you updated
as that process moves forward.

Best,

See attached comparative print. I'm comfortable with the revised version
of the CCC definition of "administrative decision" and their proposed
amendment to "legislative action."

	Hi Darin and Janet,

	=20

	I wanted to reach out to you all with a draft of the legislation
related to updating the District=E2=80=99s lobbying disclosure laws to include
procurement actions so as to fall in line with other jurisdictions. I=E2=80=
=99m
hoping you all might take a look at what I=E2=80=99ve drafted up, and tell me=
 if
you think it adequately addresses the issues you identified in your
recent letter. Feel free to red line or give me a call to discuss any
changes or issues with the text, as drafted.

	=20

	As I mentioned to Janet, there is no rush on getting edits back
to me =E2=80=93 we would likely introduce any legislation next month at the
earliest.

	=20

	Thanks for any thoughts.

	=20

	Best,
