Letter from the Mayor


Dear Washingtonians,

On December 1, 2017, I issued a Mayor=E2=80=99s Order directing the Office of
the State Superintendent of Education to conduct an independent
investigation into the allegations raised around Ballou Senior High
School and how the attendance policies at DC's public high schools have
been applied as they relate to graduation eligibility. This week, we
released the preliminary findings of the investigation. The
District-wide report is due to me in two weeks, and we will share those
findings with the community at that time.

Going forward, we will continue to put students first, focus on equity
and excellence, and have the courage to improve. Our job is to
investigate, tell you what we know, and make appropriate changes for the
good of our students. And that is what we will do. We will continue to
call on students to attend school every day; on parents to prioritize
attendance and take advantage of the resources the District offers; on
educators to adhere to the policies we set, communicate those policies
to families, and continue to push our students every single day; and on
the staff at DCPS Central Office to develop policies that set students
up for success and ensure all stakeholders know and follow those
policies.

Together, we will continue to set high expectations for our students and
give them the opportunities and support they need to realize their full
potential. Together, we will make every day count
<https://attendance.dc.gov/> .

Sincerely,=20

Shot<https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/DCWASH/201
8/01/1742576/1708464/flu-ad-father-son_crop.jpg>=20

The DC Department of Health (DOH) is encouraging District residents who
have not been vaccinated for influenza (flu) to get their annual flu
shot to prevent the continued spread of the virus. The District is
currently experiencing an increase in reported flu cases, and this is
expected to continue in the weeks ahead.=20

Those who have not already been vaccinated for the flu should contact
their primary care physician and/or health care provider to get their
annual flu shot. Residents can also go to https://vaccinefinder.org
<https://vaccinefinder.org>  to find a location to get vaccinated.

Last week, in celebration of the Year of the Anacostia
<http://www.yearoftheanacostia.com/> , Mayor Bowser announced
significant conservation and investment commitments for Kingman and
Heritage Islands. The Mayor directed the DC Department of Energy and
Environment to designate portions of both islands as a State
Conservation Area and the southern area of Kingman Island as a Critical
Wildlife Area. The State Conservation Area designation mimics the
federal covenant for the islands, restricting their use to
environmental, educational, and recreational purposes. In addition, the
Mayor also announced a new $4.7 million investment for educational and
recreational improvements on the islands.=20
