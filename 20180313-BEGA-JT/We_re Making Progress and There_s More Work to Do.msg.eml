Letter from the Mayor


Dear Washingtonians,

Tonight, I will release my Year Three Transition Plan Accountability
Report <https://year3accountabiltyupdate.eventbrite.com/> , a
comprehensive look into my Administration's goals and priorities, our
progress, and the work we still have left to do. When I was sworn into
office, I pledged to work with all of you to make a greener, healthier,
safer, and more fiscally stable city.=20

By making bold and pragmatic plans and executing them every day, we've
made tremendous progress:

*	Through unprecedented investments and a renewed sense of
urgency, we have sparked the creation or preservation of nearly 10,000
units of affordable housing. And after our first full year of
implementing Homeward DC, we saw a 22 percent reduction in family
homelessness and a 10.5 percent reduction in overall homelessness. But
until every Washingtonian has a safe and affordable place to live, we
have more work to do.
*	Our Safer, Stronger DC plan is working - since 2014, total crime
is down 14 percent and violent crime is down 28 percent. But we won't be
satisfied with any level of crime, so we have more work to do.
*	After ten years of education reform, our public schools are not
only serving more families, they continue to raise student achievement
and expand opportunities for our young people both inside and outside
the classroom. But until all students are performing at the highest
levels and we have eliminated long-standing opportunity and achievement
gaps, there is more work to do.=20

*	And by connecting residents to jobs, health care, education, and
housing, we are getting more Washingtonians on pathways to the middle
class. But even as we reduce unemployment and continue adding new jobs,
we know that stark disparities still exist in our community, so we have
more work to do.=20

Together, we will continue to build on our city's progress. Washington,
DC has never experienced better days and our best days are yet to come.

Sincerely,=20

The District offers two environmentally-friendly ways for residents to
recycle Christmas trees and greenery. Between January 13 and February 2,
residents can put their trees and greenery out with trash and recycling,
to be collected on regularly scheduled recycling days
<https://dpw.dc.gov/service/find-your-trash-and-recycling-collection-sch
edule>  during this period. This collection service is only available to
residents who are serviced by the Department of Public Works. (Note: In
years past, residents could place their trees in the tree box space,
adjacent to the curb. This is not the case this year, unless that is
where recycling is normally collected.)

Residents can also bring their trees and greenery to either of the
District=E2=80=99s transfer stations - the Fort Totten Transfer Station (4900
John F. McCormack Drive, NE) or the Benning Road Transfer Station (3200
Benning Road, NE).

Before disposing of a tree or greenery, all ornaments and lights should
be removed. Residents are also asked not to bag their trees or greenery.
