Thanks, Brian.  Your exchange with Mr. Sampson raises a concern that I expres=
sed initially when we were considering waivers: what is the standard for gran=
ting a waiver?  If it is sufficient to just express concern over identity the=
ft, then we would have to grant waivers for everyone.  Between the OPM, Equif=
ax, Yahoo, etc breaches, I doubt that there are many board/commission members=
 whose information has not been compromised.

Just FYI =E2=80=93 I think the concerns they raise are addressed in my respon=

Hi Brian-

 December 14.  I=E2=80=99m unsure if you personally confirmed that date at 1 =

Hi Erie - those are two distinct valid concerns. The first would require a st=
atutory change. If we didn=E2=80=99t include a confirming repealer in our Com=
prehensive Code of Conduct bill, we will recommend it.  As to the second conc=
ern, the Ethics Board has the authority to waive parts of the public filing r=
equirements and has fairly routinely protected the public disclosure of emplo=
yee filings upon a showing of good cause. It is a low threshold and they have=
 been routinely granted in the past.

I=E2=80=99m out of the office today, but will be in tomorrow if you want to d=
iscuss this further.

Hi Brian-

Thanks for your prompt reply.  DCRB trustees expressed two specific concerns =
with the proposed amendment=E2=80=94 duplicative filings and online publicati=
on of personal information. First, pursuant to DC Code Section 1-909.01, trus=
tees are already required to submit financial disclosure statements annually =
to the Council and the Mayor.  Two separate disclosure forms and filing requi=
rements would serve no additional value while imposing a burdensome and dupli=
cative process on DCRB trustees.  I=E2=80=99m unaware of similar filing requi=
rements for other boards and commissions, so this is an issue unique to DCRB.=
  Second, with the exponential growth in computer hacking, data mining and in=
cidents involving the actions of persons (either acting independently or when=
 hired by foreign governments), the trustees are concerned that their persona=
l information would be seen online and potentially sold on the dark web.  How=
 do you recommend that we address these two concerns?

Regards,

Erie

Hi Erie =E2=80=93 we essentially view it as a conforming amendment, to make s=
ure that all public officials file the same form, containing the same informa=
tion.  Note that we are also considering requiring members of additional Boar=
ds and Commissions who are not currently required to file, to file public fin=
ancial disclosure statements (PFDS).  Our authority to do this derives from D=
.C. Official Code =C2=A7 1-1161.01(47) (=E2=80=9CPublic official=E2=80=9D mea=

Hi Brian-

I trust that all is well for you. Quick question: We noticed a proposed amend=
ment for DCRB trustees to file their annual financial disclosure form with BE=
GA, presumably in lieu of filing with the Mayor and Council. Although we=E2=
=80=99re not necessarily opposed to this amendment, would you please provide =
the rationale for the change and any key points that our trustees should unde=
rstand about this change. Our board meeting is on Thursday, so any feedback b=
eforehand would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Erie
