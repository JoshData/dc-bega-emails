Good morning, Kate.

=20

Just touching base.  Now that the record is closed on the CCC, we were
wondering about next steps.  Also, can we get copies of all the
testimony?  We=E2=80=99d especially like to see what those folks who didn=E2=
=80=99t
testify at the hearing had to say, so that we can factor their comments
into decisions about revising the bill and the accompanying
section-by-section analysis.

=20

Thanks.

Kate, here are e-copies of the PowerPoint and Tameka's testimony.  I'll
bring a thumb drive with the PowerPoint on it (just in case) and 20 hard
copies of the testimony.

Thanks.  See you in the morning.
