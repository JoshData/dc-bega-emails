Hi Jack,





Many thanks for the CCC materials. Super helpful as Sonia preps for the
hearing.




Re the emergency, from what I can recall, we didn't amend the quorum
requirement when we increased the board size because of our fear that
the Executive would delay in sending qualified nominees to us (as is
always=E2=80=8B the case). I wouldn't want to put you in a bind where you have
one or two vacancies and all your sitting members have to attend every
meeting. Either way, can you make the case why it's an emergency? I'm
generally a bit skittish of emergencies.





Thanks much,





Kate

Good morning, Kate.

=20

In follow-up to our meeting on August 29, I=E2=80=99m attaching the latest
(redlined) version of the CCC bill and a clean copy of the accompanying
section-by-section analysis.  The redlining reflects revisions to the
bill made since the legislation was initially filed in 2015 (Bill
21-250) and, as such, also reflects the differences between the latest
version and the re-introduced Bill 22-136.  We=E2=80=99ll likely make a number
of other revisions and will send them along as well in advance of the
November 2 hearing as possible.

=20

The quorum package is intended to address what was likely an oversight
(that is, increasing the Ethics Board=E2=80=99s quorum requirement) when the
size of the Board was increased from three members to five.  See the
dec.  We=E2=80=99re wondering (hoping, actually) if the Councilmember would
introduce the package for us.  The package doesn=E2=80=99t include a permanent
bill because we figure we could put the substantive amending provision
in the CCC bill.  Please call if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks. =20
